# 🔔 Notification System Upgrade - Summary

## What We Changed

### ❌ **Removed:**
- **NotificationContext.jsx** - Complex Firestore-based notification system
- **NotificationsPage.jsx** - Dedicated notifications page
- **NotificationDropdown** - Navigation dropdown for notifications
- **createNotification()** calls throughout the app

### ✅ **Added:**

#### 1. **Toast Notification System**
- **ToastContext.jsx** - Simple in-memory toast management
- **ToastContainer.jsx** - Floating toast UI component
- **Auto-dismiss** - Toasts disappear after 4 seconds
- **4 Types:** Success (green), Error (red), Warning (yellow), Info (blue)

#### 2. **Application Status Tracking**
- **ApplicationContext.jsx** - Tracks user's team applications in real-time
- **Dashboard Status Cards** - Shows accepted/rejected applications
- **Persistent Status** - Application updates remain visible until seen

#### 3. **Updated User Experience**

**Before:**
```
User applies → Notification in database → Check notifications page
```

**After:**
```
User applies → Instant toast "Application sent!" 
              ↓
Team owner accepts → Toast "John accepted!" 
                    ↓
Applicant sees → Dashboard "You were accepted to TeamX!"
```

## 🎯 **Improved User Experience**
